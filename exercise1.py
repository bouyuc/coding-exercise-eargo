# Write a function to calculate change for a given number (number represents cents) 
# The function will return list, vector or collection of numbers representing the number of 
# quarters(25), dimes(10), nickels (5), pennies (1) that would yield the correct change.
# Example:
# For 83Â¢, the function will return 3 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies.

# Input is cents as integers
# Output is a dictionary of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
